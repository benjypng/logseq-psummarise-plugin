# Introduction

This plugin tries to emulate the Progressive Summarisation approacy by Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course.

In short, you read through the article, and **bold** text that speaks to you. Then you read through the bold text again and ==highlight== text that really distils the essence of what is speaking to you. I am somewhat butchering the finer details of the approach, so please consult the article below for further reading.

# Usage

Copy and paste the text that you would like to distil into Logseq. As per Tiago's approach, go through the passage and bold "keywords, key phrases, and key sentences that I feel represent the core or essence of the idea being discussed." When finished, click the plugin icon and watch your bolded sentences appear in a section below the article.

Then, when you are ready to do further distiling, go through the bolded passages in Layer 1 and highlight those that are "the 'best of the best', only highlighting something if it is truly unique or valuable". This layer will then be at the very top of the page, and the actual article below for further reference.

You can then go further up the layers, and finally complete the entire Progressive Summarisation approach (see below).
